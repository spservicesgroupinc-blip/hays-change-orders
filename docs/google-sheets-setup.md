# Google Sheets + Apps Script setup

The app stores every change-order draft as a row in a Google Sheet and keeps
the uploaded source PDFs in a Google Drive folder. The frontend talks to a
deployed Apps Script web app.

## 1. Create the spreadsheet

1. Go to <https://sheets.google.com> and create a new blank spreadsheet named
   **Hays Change Orders**.
2. Optionally rename the first sheet. The script creates a **Drafts** sheet
   automatically on first use, so the default sheet can stay.

## 2. Paste the script

1. In the spreadsheet, open **Extensions → Apps Script**.
2. Delete the placeholder `Code.gs` content and paste the entire contents of
   `apps-script/Code.gs`.
3. The script must be a **container-bound** script (created from inside the
   spreadsheet). Do not paste it into a standalone project, because
   `SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet()` only works when bound to the sheet.

The `appsscript.json` manifest (`apps-script/appsscript.json`) is provided for
reference. In the Apps Script editor you can confirm the runtime by going to
**Project Settings** and checking that it runs under V8. The web-app settings
(execute as the deploying user, access: Anyone) are set during deployment in
step 4.

## 3. Run the one-time setup

1. In the Apps Script editor, select the `setup` function from the toolbar
   dropdown and click **Run** — or reload the spreadsheet and use the
   **Change Orders → Run one-time setup** menu.
2. Accept the OAuth consent for **Google Sheets** and **Google Drive** when
   prompted.
3. `setup()` creates the **Drafts** sheet (legacy change orders), the
   **Requests** sheet (PM request queue), the **Jobs** sheet (job directory),
   and the **hays-change-orders** Drive folder. It shows a dialog with the
   deploy instructions.

Re-running `setup()` is safe: it reuses the existing sheets and folder. If the
spreadsheet already has a **Jobs** sheet from an earlier version, `setup()`
adds the new `contractAmount` header automatically — no manual column insert is
needed (see the Job directory note below).

> No API key is needed. Deploy the web app with access "Anyone" and keep the
> Web app URL private. For real authentication, add Google Sign-In later.

## 4. Deploy as a web app

1. In the Apps Script editor, click **Deploy → New deployment**.
2. Choose type **Web app**.
3. Description: `Hays change orders`.
4. **Execute as:** `Me (your account)`.
5. **Who has access:** `Anyone`.
6. Click **Deploy**, authorize if prompted, and copy the **Web app URL**. It
   looks like `https://script.google.com/macros/s/<id>/exec`.

Whenever you edit `Code.gs` later, create a **new deployment** (or edit the
existing one and point it to the new version) for production users to see the
change.

## 5. Point the app at it

Create `c:\Users\russe\hays-change-orders\.env.local` with:

```ini
VITE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL=https://script.google.com/macros/s/<id>/exec
```

Then restart `npm run dev` (Vite reads `.env.local` at startup).

## 6. Verify

1. Open <http://127.0.0.1:3010>, create a request, and upload a small PDF.
2. In the spreadsheet, a **Requests** sheet should appear with one queue row
   (the full request JSON lives in a per-request Drive folder).
3. In Google Drive, a folder named **hays-change-orders** should contain the
   uploaded PDF and a `request-<id>` folder with revision snapshots.
4. Open the app in a second browser/device: the request should appear in the
   queue, and attachments should load from Drive.

## Notes

- **Requests (V2)**: the **Requests** sheet holds searchable queue metadata
  (status, estimator, job, counts). The full request JSON is stored as
  immutable revision files in a request-owned Drive folder, so a save or claim
  cannot be overwritten by a competing window. Attachments are staged in the
  request folder and only linked once a save references them.
- **Legacy drafts**: the **Drafts** sheet and the `list/open/save/delete/pdf/
  uploadPdf` endpoints remain for the legacy four-step editor. Converting a
  legacy draft copies its PDFs into a new request and carries prior pricing
  forward for estimator review.
- **Upload size**: the client caps uploads at 15 MB. Apps Script web-app POST
  bodies are limited, and files travel as base64 (~1.33× their size).
- **Job directory**: the **Jobs** sheet is maintained from the app's **Jobs**
  page — import the Dash JobSummaryReport CSV (`GET ?action=listJobs`,
  `POST {action:"importJobs"}`). Importing replaces the whole list. Project
  managers pick a job in the request form to autofill the job number,
  customer, property address, and responsible project manager, plus the
  customer's **original contract amount** when the uploaded report carries one.
  That amount comes from the export's **`Estimate Amount`** column (the parser
  also accepts `Total Estimate Amount`, `Contract Amount`, `Original Contract
  Amount`, `Original Contract`, `Contract Price`, `Contract Total`, `Total
  Contract Amount`, and `Est. Amount` — a last-resort abbreviation — as
  fallbacks) and pre-fills the estimator's "Original
  contract amount" field, which stays editable. The sheet's columns are `id,
  jobNumber, customer, address, projectManager, estimator, status,
  customerPhone, customerEmail, active, updatedAt, contractAmount` —
  `contractAmount` is appended **last** so a spreadsheet created before the
  column existed keeps every existing column aligned.
- **Jobs sheet self-heals (no manual column insert)**: on the **first**
  `listJobs` / `importJobs` / `setup` call after a deployment, `jobsSheet_()`
  fills in only the empty header cells, so an already-deployed 11-column Jobs
  sheet gains its `contractAmount` header at column 12 by itself. It never
  inserts, clears, renames, or reorders existing columns or job rows, and does
  nothing once the header row is complete — a `JOBS_HEADERS_VERSION` script
  property records the verified header version, so this check runs once per
  deployment rather than on every list/bootstrap call. Deploy the updated
  `Code.gs` (step 4: **Deploy → New deployment**) for the deployed web app to
  know about the new column; the spreadsheet itself needs no edits.
- **Limits**: list/open return JSON; the sheet stores summaries rather than
  full documents.
- **Revisions**: saves and status changes carry an expected revision and a
  retry identifier, so a stale tab cannot overwrite a newer edit.
- **Local tests** expect the default local API path (`/__api__`) and are mocked
  in Playwright. Do not point `.env.local` at the real URL while running the
  browser tests.
